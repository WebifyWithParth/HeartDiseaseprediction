# Heart Disease Prediction Model  

## Overview  
This project is a simple machine learning web application that predicts the presence of heart disease based on user input. The model is trained using logistic regression and deployed using **Streamlit**.  

## Features  
- Predict heart disease based on input features  
- Displays model accuracy on training and test datasets  
- Showcases dataset overview and predictions interactively  
- Lightweight and easy-to-run web application  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)  

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this project is included in the repository as `heart_disease_data.csv`. It contains features such as:  
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest pain type  
- Resting blood pressure  
- Serum cholesterol  
- Fasting blood sugar  
- Resting ECG results  
- Maximum heart rate  
- Exercise-induced angina  
- Oldpeak  
- Slope, ca, and thal values  
- Target (presence or absence of heart disease)  

## How to Run the Project  

1. **Clone the repository:**
